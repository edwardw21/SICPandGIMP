# SICPandGIMP
Image manipulation library leveraging capabilities of the SICP Picture Language as well as the GIMP Photo Editing Library. 

For SICP, the we can mostly borrow the functionality from the Picture Language (see here for SICP codebase: https://github.com/sicp-lang/sicp), but we will require some changes to accommodate images which are not squares (aspect ratio 1). 

The appropriate changes will be stored in the file main.rkt in this repository.
