# SICPandGIMP
Image manipulation library leveraging capabilities of the SICP Picture Language as well as the GIMP Photo Editing Library. 

For the SICP Picture Language, we can mostly borrow the functionality from the Picture Language (see here for SICP codebase: https://github.com/sicp-lang/sicp), but we will require some changes because the picture language only considers square images. 

The appropriate changes are stored in the file main.rkt in this repository.
